# SAS Visual Investigator Solution Extensions

## Overview

Solution extensions allow new controls with custom functionality to be deployed to an existing SAS Visual Investigator deployment. There are multiple tools available to ease the development and deployment of these solution extensions.

See the documentation and examples provided here for help with these tools.

### Prerequisites

You must have access to a deployment of SAS Visual Investigator 10.8 (or later) to use the documented tools.

### Installation

#### NPM

We have several packages published to npm that are referenced and used in these guides and documentation.

We recommend using the ``@sassoftware/vi-solution-extension-create`` package to create a project that downloads and installs these for you. For more information, see the [Getting Started](documentation/guides) section of our guide.

Alternatively, you can download and install packages individually using npm in the command line of any Angular or TypeScript project. To do this, run:

````shell
npm i [PACKAGE_NAME]
````

See our packages below:

* [``@sassoftware/vi-solution-extension-create``](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sassoftware/vi-solution-extension-create)
* [``@sassoftware/vi-solution-extension-angular-schematics``](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sassoftware/vi-solution-extension-angular-schematics)
* [``@sassoftware/vi-solution-extension-upload``](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sassoftware/vi-solution-extension-upload)
* [``@sassoftware/vi-api``](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sassoftware/vi-api)
