# Overview

Solution extensions allow new controls with custom functionality to be deployed to an existing SAS Visual Investigator deployment. There are multiple tools available to ease the development and deployment of these solution extensions.

See the documentation and examples provided here for help with these tools.

## Prerequisites

### Desktop Solution Extensions

You must have access to a deployment of SAS Visual Investigator 10.8 (or later) to use the documented tools.

### Mobile Solution Extensions

SAS Mobile Investigator does not support custom controls in 10.8 and will therefore must have access to a deployment of SAS Visual Investigator on Viya 4 to use the documented tools.

## Installation

### NPM

We have several packages published to npm that are referenced and used in these guides and documentation.

You should use the `@sassoftware/vi-solution-extension-create` package to create a workspace that downloads and installs these for you. For more information, see the [Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md) section of our guide.
